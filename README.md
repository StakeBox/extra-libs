For a variety of reasons, some of the wallets for the StakeBox had to be compiled using Ubuntu on the Raspberry Pi 2, and as such are compiled against different libraries than the others. These are those libraries. If a wallet doesn't start for you try starting it via a terminal, if you get an error regarding missing libboost or libminiupnpc placing the files in this repository into /usr/lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf will solve the issue.
